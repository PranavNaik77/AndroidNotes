This app displays a variety of weather data for a specified location – current weather, hourly forecast (48 hours), and daily forecast (7 days).
The app is made up of 2 activities – the home weather screen, and the daily forecast screen.
The home weather screen will need an alternate layout for landscape orientation (see images). The daily forecast screen will not need an alternate landscape layout – the same layout should work in any orientation.
The data that makes up the current weather, hourly forecast, and daily forecast are detailed in the images in this document.
The units (C/F) can be toggled between imperial and metric by tapping an options-menu icon.
The daily forecast is displayed by tapping the calendar icon in the options-menu.
The location for the displayed weather can be changed by tapping the location icon in the options-menu.
